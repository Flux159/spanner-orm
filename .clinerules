# Cline Rules

- Ensure all new code includes corresponding tests in the "/test" folder.
- Verify tests pass by running "bun run test".
- Check linting by running "bun run lint" and resolve all issues.
- Ensure the project builds successfully using "bun run build".

To use a tagged template literal with "sql", you want to do something like sql<backtick>CURRENT_TIMESTAMP<backtick> - DO NOT USE backslashes because that will be invalid syntax.
